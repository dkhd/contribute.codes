          CYC aims to help people with interest in open source and willing to
          contribute, but want to start with something smaller &amp; less
          popular. In short, CYC is here to help you find the right projects.

          One major problem for beginner contributors is they need something
          smaller to begin with, so they can get a grasp on how to contribute to
          open source. Those awesome websites I mentioned above will mostly
          suggest the users to contribute to big &amp; massive projects that
          might be scary or intimidating to a beginner contributor.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-5">
          CYC will fill the gaps by providing you with more advanced search, so
          you can give your first contribution to an active open source project
          but less popular. These projects are usually have less stars and less
          forks compared to the big &amp; massive projects with thousands of
          stars and forks.
